### 1.0.3
- Fix bug with settings dialog where conversions without resizing were not allowed due to faulty logic which enabled the `OK` button.

### 1.0.2
- Support for saving as `PNG` has been removed.
- You can now set the quality for `JPG`/`WebP` encoding. They both accept values between `0-100`. The previous default for `WebP` was `95`. I'm not sure about `JPG`.

### 1.0.1
- Initial release
